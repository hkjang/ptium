# What it does: checks the version is stamped in every file that carries it,
# builds the offline bundle (which runs the first-run and upgrade checks and
# stops the release if either fails), then pushes, tags and publishes with the
# seven files a target site downloads.
#
# It exists because doing this by hand went wrong: build-offline.sh exits 1 when
# a check fails, but its output was being read through `| tail`, and a
# pipeline's status is the last command's. A release went out on a build that
# had failed. Nothing here is piped, and every step's status stops the rest.
